    <p class="why"> The Future is in the Web Development in its all.  I decided a carreer change, after having
      worked in the fields such as logistic and IT support (Microsoft product specialist). I'am a very enthusiastic and creative person with a wide
      range of interests. The main reason why I want to become a web developer due to the fact that it comes with the creativity and the concept
      of designing a web page.
      Furthermore, I believe that the web devepolment fields would mean a lot for my personal development, because it
      would be a unique and invaluable experience to learn about new technologies, to share different views, to
      communicate with people from many nations and to achieve goals together.</p>

    <h1 class="webdev" id="WB">Web Development Definition</h1>
  </b>

  <p class="center"> Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes
    aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.

    While the terms <b>"web developer"</b> and <b>"web designer"</b> are often used synonymously, they do not mean the
    same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using <b>HTML and CSS</b> . A web
    developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as
    <b>PHP and ASP</b>. Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic
    website.

    Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages
    in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging
    website. In recent years, content management systems like, <b>Drupal, and Joomla</b> have also become
    popular means of web development. These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own
    website using a web-based interface.

    While there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between simplicity and
    customization. Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have
    a dedicated Web development team that designs and maintains the company's website(s). Small
    organizations and individuals are more likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic
    website template and simplified editing tools.
